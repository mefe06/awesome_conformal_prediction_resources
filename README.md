This is a collection of conformal prediction resources I found and used in my journey in learning conformal prediction.

For a more verbal introduction with applied cases of conformal prediction: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07511

For a more mathematically rigorous introduction:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07972, https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/statlearn-s23/lectures/conformal.pdf

A paper that investigates conformal prediction for time series: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/xu21h/xu21h.pdf
